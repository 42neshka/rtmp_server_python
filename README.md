## Introduction

RTMP is a protocol used for streaming audio, video, and data over the internet. This project aims to provide a basic RTMP server implementation in Python, allowing you to build your own streaming server or integrate RTMP functionality into your applications.

Please note that this implementation is not complete and only includes basic handlers. You may need to extend or modify it to suit your specific requirements.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the Python RTMP server:

- Python 3.x

## Usage

To use this RTMP server implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file, if any.
3. Customize the server implementation by adding your own logic to the provided basic handlers or extending the existing functionality.
4. Start the RTMP server by running the main Python file, typically named `rtmp.py` or similar.

```bash
python rtmp.py
```
